# Potato Leaf Disease Prediction Project Description

Here, we’ll develop an end-to-end Deep Learning project in the field of agriculture. We will create a simple Image Classification Model that will categorize Potato Leaf Disease using a simple and classic Convolutional Neural Network Architecture. We’ll start with collecting the data, then model building.

This dataset is basically taken from this source (https://www.kaggle.com/abbasataiemontazer/potato-leaf).
